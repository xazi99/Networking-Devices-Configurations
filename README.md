Fault Tolerance
A fault tolerant network is one that limits the number of affected devices during a failure. It is built to allow quick recovery when such a failure occurs. These networks depend on multiple paths between the source and destination of a message. If one path fails, the messages are instantly sent over a different link.
Redundacy is having multiple parts to reach the destination.

#Scalability
A scalable network expands quickly to support new users and applications. It does this without degrading the performance of services that are being accessed by existing users.

# Quality of Service
Quality of Service (QoS) is an increasing requirement of networks today.Congestion occurs when the demand for bandwidth exceeds the amount available.
 Network bandwidth is measured in the number of bits that can be transmitted in a single second, or bits per second (bps).

# Network Security
Securing the network infrastructure includes physically securing devices that provide network connectivity and preventing unauthorized access to the management software that resides on them.
Confidentiality - Data confidentiality means that only the intended and authorized recipients can access and read data.
Integrity - Data integrity assures users that the information has not been altered in transmission, from origin to destination.
Availability - Data availability assures users of timely and reliable access to data services for authorized users.

#Hierarchical Network Design
  #Physical and Logical Addresses
A person's name usually does not change. A person's address on the other hand, relates to where the person lives and can change. On a host, the MAC address does not change; it is physically assigned to the host NIC and is known as the physical address. The physical address remains the same regardless of where the host is placed on the network.
IP addresses contain two parts. One part identifies the network portion.The network portion of the IP address will be the same for all hosts connected to the same local network. The second part of the IP address identifies the individual host on that network.
